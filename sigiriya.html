<h1>ANCIENT CITY OF SIGIRIYA</h1>
<img id="mainSigiriya" src="Pictures/Heritage Locations/Sigiriya/sigiriya-main-terrace.webp">

<p>
This is one of the most popular tourist destinations in Sri Lanka. In 1982, UNESCO declared the Ancient City of Sigiriya as a World Heritage Site.  
The Sigiriya Rock was declared as the 8th wonder of the world by UNESCO. 
The fortress on top of the 'Lion Rock' was built by King Kasyapa who ruled Ceylon from 477 to 495 CE.

    <h2>History</h2>
    Sigiriya was the capital city under the ruling of King Kasyapa until he was defeated in 495 CE by his brother. 
    Kasyapa was illegitimate to be the King because he was born to his father's non-royal mistress. Moggallana, brother of Kasyapa was the rightful one to sit on the throne after King Dhatusena but Kasyapa went against his father and killed him to take the throne. 
    Afterwards, King Kasyapa formed his kingdom in the city of Sigiriya where he built his palace on top of the 'Lion Rock'.

<p>
    <h2>The Lion Rock</h2>
    The King built the entrance gateway in the form of lion paws where the staircase emerges to enter the rock. 
    The rock is 200 meters in height and requires 1,200 steps by the staircase to reach the top. He also constructed garden landscapes, advanced water systems which provide water to the gardens from the canals, lakes and dams till today. 
    The architectural features used are amazing. Moreover, the King created a mirror wall so that he could see himself walking. The mirror wall was turned into a graffiti board known as ‘Sigiri Graffiti’ where visitors scribbled their message. The garden is said to be the oldest surviving in the whole of Asia.
    Note: It would be ideal to visit the Sigiriya museum before climbing the rock, where you can find and understand the history and culture of this mesmerizing site!
