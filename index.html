        <h3>Flag & The People</h3>
    <p>
        The first king of Sri Lanka brought a flag with a lion symbol on it when he conquered and from then on the flag went through many changes. 
        However, the main lion symbol remains as it represents the Sinhalese ethnicity and bravery of the nation. 
        Whereas the orange and green stripe which was added later on represents Tamils and Muslims of the country respectively.
    </p>

    <p>
        Mainly you will find Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims in Sri Lanka, as they are the three main ethnic groups in Sri Lanka. 
        The people of Sri Lanka always have a smile on their face and are eager to help the people in need.
